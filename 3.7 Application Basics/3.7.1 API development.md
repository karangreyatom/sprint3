# Overview 
Node.js allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use directly on a server OS. NodeJS environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries. Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. Using Express you can write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes). You can also integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.Express allows you to set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.

# Learning Outcomes
- Creating REST endpoints on local machine
- How to get started quickly with minimal code

## Introduction
Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for NodeJS. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
