# Overview
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware. Itâ€™s commonly used to edit the request or response objects, or terminate the request before it reaches the route handler code. Middleware is added to the execution stack like ``` app.use((req, res, next) => { /* */ }) ```

## Introduction
Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it, enabling communication and data management. It is often used to check headers, add headers like the visit number to limit the amount of how many times you can visit a certain service, like you can only fetch 10 times per minute. Middleware usually can just reject and therefore cancel the web request, it can redirect all calls to f.ex. a login page if you are not logged in. It checks like can you edit this record, can you write and so forth. If all goes well, it just calls next which tells your system to run next middleware call.
