# Overview
Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data - think XML, but smaller. Protobuf offers a more dense format (faster processing) and provides data schemas (enforcement of structure and better compatibility with old code). Protobufs are backward compatibility by design, has less boilerplate, has validations and is extensible.

## Introduction
Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
