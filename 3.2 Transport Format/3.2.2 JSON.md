# Overview
JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight text-based designed for human-readable data interchange. The filename extension is .json. Web services generally return data in JSON format. They are easier to implement, easy to read and write and  language independent.

## Introduction
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). As stated in the MDN, some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript.
An example of where this is used is web services responses. In the 'old' days, web services used XML as their primary data format for transmitting back data, but since JSON appeared, it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweight.
JSON is built on two structures:
- A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
- An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.
