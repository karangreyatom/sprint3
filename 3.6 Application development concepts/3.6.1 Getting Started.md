# Overview
Node.js is perfect for building APIs. It has a short learning curve, especially for developers with JavaScript experience. You can extend your talent base without adding extra hires since developers can work on both the front and back ends. Node.js works in small tasks, which is fast in any case but also ideal for microservices. It also rests quietly while waiting on data returns, which frees resources so they can be used elsewhere in the interim. There are things to keep in mind while designing a NodeJS application to fully exploit the benefits of it.

## Introduction
Architecture is the high-level framework, foundation or skeleton of the software system. It's a choice made early on about the foundation of the system. That choice has the effect to greatly influence the quality of the code, ease of development, deployment, maintainance, and continued work on the system. While a developer without knowledge of the high-level details may be able to work on a low-level feature in a system, the opposite isn't true. An architecture helps people work better in teams, as if speaking the same language, they understand each other in no time. NodeJS includes an out-of-process debugging utility accessible via a V8 Inspector and built-in debugging client.
