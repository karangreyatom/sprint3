# Overview
Javascript is a single-threaded language, this in certain situations can be very limiting because the process is stuck executing on one thread and can't fully utilize the CPU it is running on but thanks to concurrency, it's single-threaded nature is less of a problem. Concurrency means two or more processes running together in one thread but not at the same time. Concurrency is great and all but there is one side effect to writing code with concurrent behavior and it is affectionately called the **Callback Hell**. The problem an be avoided when you use Promises. **Promises** are javascript structures that "Promise" the resolution/failure of asynchronous code and help us handle their successes/failures in a syntactically synchronous manner. But it doesn't fully clean up the code. Promises also come along the **async/await** keywords which will be extra helpful in cleaning up our code.

# Learning Outcomes
- Execution Context in JavaScript
- What is concurrency and why it's needed?
- Sequential process execution
- Callback hell - what it is and how to escape it
- Parallel process execution

## Introduction
Backend languages were not designed for concurrency back in the day. It made the languages simple and maintainable for both core developers and application developers. But with complexity and faster data requirements with [Moore's law](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Moores-law-in-laymans-terms), these languages were increasing the cost and not fully utilizing the multiple cores. Backend languages needed to be concurrent.
