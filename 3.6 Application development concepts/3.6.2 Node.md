# Overview
Node.js is especially suited for applications where you'd like to maintain a persistent connection from the browser back to the server. When you use Node.js, the server has no need of maintaining separate threads for each open connection where many of the web's giants, like Ruby on Rails or Django each active client eats up one server process to write an application that sends updates to the user in real time. Node.js is best suited for real-time applications: online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, or anything where what one user (or robot? or sensor?) does with the application needs to be seen by other users immediately.

## Introduction
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment. It executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). It is used for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
