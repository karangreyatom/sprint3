# Overview
Without HTTP Status codes, the application wonâ€™t ever really know if their API request was successful or not, and even if an application can tell there was a failure, it will never understand why. 200 (good), 301 (Moved Somewhere else, new URL in the response), 400 (Bad Syntax), 403 (Not Authorized), 404 (Nothing on that address), 500 (Server Error: Bad (more work) if backend developer, good (not your problem) if consumer).
