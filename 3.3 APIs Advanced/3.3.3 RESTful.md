# Overview
REST(REpresentational State Transfer) is based on standard HTTP operations, it uses verbs with specific meanings such as "get" or "delete" which avoids ambiguity. By REST we mean the constraints â€” the client server relationship, statelessness, cacheability, layering, code on demand, and having a uniform interface.. REST demands the use of hypertext, which scales very well since the client and server are very loosely coupled. With REST, the server is free to change the exposed resources at will.

## Introduction
REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. We will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial characteristics for services on the Web.

## Assessment Quiz
1. What among the following components would you as a backend developer use to pass filtered collection?
- `Create a new API which will return filtered collection`
- `Add the input parameters as query parameters to existing URL` [Correct answer]
- `Create a new POST request and ask for input parameters in the body`
- `Will not make any changes since it's frontend developer's responsibilty to filter the collection on his side`
