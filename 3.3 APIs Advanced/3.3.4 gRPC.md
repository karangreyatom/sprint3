# Overview
gRPC is an open-source RPC framework. It uses a protobuf to run through generators to create a backend. It is a good fit for deploying inside an organization. It uses HTTP/2 to support highly performant and scalable API's and makes use of binary data rather than just text which makes the communication more compact and more efficient. gRPC makes better use of HTTP/2 then REST. With gRPC, a customer can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object.

## Introduction
gRPC is a modern, open source, high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. gRPC enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and simplifies the building of connected systems. It is a transport mechanism that sends and receives messages between two systems. These two systems are traditionally a server and a client. Google RPC is specially designed to transfer data in the form of protocol buffers.
