# Overview
Postman is an application for testing APIs, by sending request to the web server and getting the response back. This tool is used by both the testers and developers alike. Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code or upgrade system libraries at a later date and make sure the module still works correctly. Unit testing is the first level where most of the issues can be rectified and this saves time.

## Introduction
One of the most common ways to see companies benefiting from API monitoring is in production — making sure those live API endpoints are up, fast and returning the data that’s expected. By monitoring production endpoints, you’re in the loop as soon as anything breaks, giving you a critical head start to fix the problem before customers, partners or end-users notice. But at this point it may already be too late, as the customers will be unsatisfied and unhappy with their restful API not working or not accessable.

## Assessment Quiz
1. What tool would you use to make a simple API calls (to merely validate the api)?
- `JMeter`
- `Postman` [Correct Answer]
- `Taurus`
- `Selenium`

2. What is Functional Testing?
- `Testing is simply a test of specific functions to check if they are extensible and the errors are well handled` [Correct answer]
- `Testing whether the API works with desired traffic`
- `Monitoring the memory leaks`
- `Checks user rights management and authorization for resource access`

3. What is penetration testing?
- `Massive amounts of purely random data is forcibly input into the system in order to attempt a forced crash, overflow, or other negative behavior.`
- `Testing whether the theoretical solution works as a practical solution under a given load`
- `API is attacked by someone who has limited working knowledge of it and try to break in` [Correct Answer]
