# Overview
How to design REST APIs so that there is a clear purpose in what the API does? Define a consumable error payload,
Effectively use HTTP Status codes, Consider using JSON for POST, PUT and PATCH request bodies, Use query parameters for advanced filtering, sorting & searching, Use nouns and NOT the verbs, Use right HTTP methods.

# Learning Outcomes
- Use of HTTP verbs
- Why is API structuring required?
- Request/Response Design
- Maintainance of Code
- Reducing Product Development Time

## Introduction
The internet has no shortage on opinions on API design. But, since there's no one widely adopted standard that works in all cases, you're left with a bunch of choices: What formats should you accept? How should you authenticate? Should your API be versioned? The goal is for the API to be easy to use, easy to adopt and flexible.
