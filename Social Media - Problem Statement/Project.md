# Introduction
That's enough theory for a while. Let's create our first NodeJS application.

## About the application
This application will be a backend application that will allow users to create posts that will be read by everyone who signups for this application. Sign up with this application to be a part of global citizen. 

## What should I build?
The aim is to build a backend application for social media platform where the consumers of these APIs will be front-end applications like mobile and web.
- New user should be able to sign up for this application
- User should be able to login
- Rest of the functionalities should not work without proper authorization.
- Once logged in, user should be able to create a post
- They should be able to see a list of all the recent posts
- They should be able to comment on posts
- They should be able to fetch a post and list of comments, which you see in the list of posts (say Dashboard)
- They should be able to take down a post

## What will be checked?
- Version Control
  - Commits
  - Branching
- Quality of code
  - Database structure
  - Package structure
  - Vocabulary of REST APIs
  - Process Executions
  - Error Handling
  - Loop holes in the application
  - Scalability
- Documentation : Which API does what and how to go about consuming them?
