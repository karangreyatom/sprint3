# Overview
A document store is a database that uses a document-oriented model to store data. In a document-oriented model, data objects are stored as documents. A document is a JSON object consisting of a number of key-value pairs that you define. There is no schema, every JSON document can have its own individual set of keys. A document database is a NoSQL database. MongoDB is one of the leading NoSQL databases. It is a document based database. The motivation of the MongoDB language is to implement a data store that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. MongoDB is extremely simple to install and implement. MongoDB uses JSON or BSON documents to store data.

## Introduction
A document database contains a collection of key-value pairs stored in documents. The document databases support more complex data than the key-value stores. While it is good at storing documents, it was not designed with enterprise-strength transactions and durability in mind.
