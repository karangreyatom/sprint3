# Overview
In order to work with MongoDB, first you need to install MongoDB on your computer. Once MongoDB is installed on your computer there are several ways to connect to your MongoDB instance through MongoDB Compass and mongo interactive shell.

# Learning Outcomes

## Introduction
CRUD operations refer to the basic Insert, Read, Update and Delete operations. In the previous chapter, we learnt about how to create a database and drop the database in MongoDB. Now, let us learn how to perform CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations in MongoDB. Sometimes, using the command line interface (CLI) is required. MongoDB provides some very helpful CLI tools. Letâ€™s have a quick look at what is included in the MongoDB installation package, and what the tools and files do.
