# Overview
In an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), classes/objects in the application are mapped to database tables and operations for persistence, sometimes automagically. In a DAL (Data-Access Layer), database operations are hidden behind a code facade.
An ORM is a kind of DAL, but not all DALs are ORMs.

## Introduction
A data access layer (DAL) in computer software is a layer of a computer program which provides simplified access to data stored in persistent storage of some kind, such as an entity-relational database. 
Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a mechanism that makes it possible to address, access and manipulate objects without having to consider how those objects relate to their data sources. ORM lets programmers maintain a consistent view of objects over time, even as the sources that deliver them, the sinks that receive them and the applications that access them change.
