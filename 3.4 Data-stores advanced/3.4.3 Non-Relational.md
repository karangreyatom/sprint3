# Overview
A non-relational database is any database that does not follow the relational model provided by traditional relational database management systems. Non-relational databases have grown in popularity because they were designed to overcome the limitations of relational databases in dealing with Big Data demands. There are four big NoSQL types: key-value store, document store, column-oriented database, and graph database. Each type solves a problem that canâ€™t be solved with relational databases. **Key-Value stores** are ideal for applications with simple data models and require high velocity read & writes eg. caching. **Document databases** have flexible schema, each document can have a different set of attributes. Documents are grouped into containers based on business requirement. Due to its flexible schema and complex querying capabilities, Document Stores are popular and suitable for variety of use cases such like Content management systems or E-commerce websites. In **Column Family databases**, data is stored in cells of columns, grouped into column families. Column Family databases are designed for large volumes of data requiring high availability and are well-suited for use cases like logging and other write heavy applications. A **graph database** is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. Graph database is well-suited for applications traversing paths between entities or where there is need to query the relationship between entities and its properties with a use case like Network and IT infrastructure.

## Introduction
A non-relational database is a database that does not incorporate the table/key model that relational database management systems (RDBMS) promote. These kinds of databases require data manipulation techniques and processes designed to provide solutions to big data problems that big companies face.
