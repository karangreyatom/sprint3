# Overview
A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. Relational database organizes data in tables (or relations). A table is made up of rows and columns. A row is also called a record (or tuple). Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database. SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database. SQL is a language to operate databases; it includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows, modifying rows, etc. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) use SQL as their standard database language.

## Introduction
A relational database is a set of formally described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. The standard user and application programming interface (API) of a relational database is the Structured Query Language (SQL).
