# Overview
One hallmark of relational database systems is something known as ACID compliance. As you might have guessed, ACID is an acronym which can be expanded as **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation and **D**urability. Whereas ACID defines the key characteristics required for reliable transaction processing, the NoSQL world requires different characteristics to enable flexibility and scalability. These opposing characteristics are cleverly captured in the acronym BASE which can be expanded as **B**asically **A**vailable, **S**oft State, **E**ventual consistency.

## Introduction
Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability (ACID) is a concept referring to a database systemâ€™s four transaction properties: atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.
BASE is Basic Availability, Soft state and Eventual consistency.
