# Overview
Selection of database type based on the application is getting the base right of an architecture. The important thing is to understand the needs of your application; from the structure of your data, to the size of the data and the read and write speeds you need. If you're uncertain, you may wish to perform some data modeling to help you map out what's needed. Data modeling will help you understand the data structures necessary to build your application. Starting with a conceptual model, you can identify the entities, associated attributes, and entity relationships that you'll need. As you go through the process, it will become more apparent the type(s) of data structures you'll need to implement. Relational, Document-oriented, Key/Value, Column-oriented and Graph are few of the category of databases. You can then use these structural considerations to select the right category of database that will serve your application best.
