## Overview
We will see version control systems available, emphasis mostly on Git. Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. Since the development and release of Git, it has gained huge popularity among the developers and being open source have incorporated many features. Today, a staggering number of projects use Git for version control, both commercial and personal. Git provides the best performance when it comes to version control systems. The algorithm used under the hood manages your versions, files, and directory securely so that your work is not corrupted. Git branching model lets you have multiple local branches which are independent of each other. Git is distributed in naturewhich means that the repository or the complete code base is mirrored onto the developerâ€™s system so that he can work on it only.
    
# Learning Outcomes
- Existing services available to help you with the version control.
- When to use which kind of VCS.
- Setting it up on your PC/server.
- Consuming the existing services and the pros and cons of each.
- Making sure the files are stored to a safer end point in case your PC crashes or burns.

## Introduction
Version control (also referred to as revision control or source control) is a file storage system that tracks every change made to a file and allows you to reverse or roll back those changes. For example, if you were editing a file on your personal computer and decided to delete a section of code, you could use version control to restore that section of code in the future - even weeks or months from now.
There are services available which help you do the same and even configure it on a remote server so that it's safer.

## What you must do?
Git and SVN are widely used Versioning Systems.
- Know the lingo of the version control systems.
- [When to use Git and when to use SVN?](https://hackbrightacademy.com/blog/svn-vs-git/)
- Install [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)/[svn](https://subversion.apache.org/packages.html).
- [Remote services for when you decide which VCS to go for](https://hackernoon.com/top-10-version-control-systems-4d314cf7adea)

Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab is generally used according to the services provided.
- Creating a repository on [github](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo). Creating on bitbucket and gitlab is similar. 
- [Go ahead and create a project on github and go ahead and play with it](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
- Get familiar with commands like [clone](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-clone), [pull](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-pull), [add](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-add), [commit](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-commit), [init](https://githowto.com/create_a_project), `git push origin master`(Since the default branch is master) and `git remote add origin https://github.com/<User>/<UserRepo>.git`(to add the remote url of the repository created).
