## Overview
A Git branch is essentially an independent line of development. You can take advantage of branching when working on new features or bug fixes because it isolates your work from that of other team members. You can discard the branch if the isolated work is a failure with no repercussions.

# Learning Outcomes
- Learn about Git commands that will help you work in a better way.
- Learn about branches.
- Launch an experimental flow without losing the main flow and integrating the same with the main flow if it succeeds.
- How to work with Open source projects or Large projects with a significant team size.

## Introduction
Imagine there are parallel worlds. We have:
- A world where I have created this material, and you’re reading it.
- A world where I have created this material, but you’re not reading it.
- A world where I did not create this material.

In this parallel world concept, a Git branch is a parallel world.
You can have a branch that stays the same in one world. Then, you branch off into a different world. Once you finish your code, you can complete the initial world by merging the changes into it.

Git is a very powerful tool and if you do not settle on a branching strategy and associated workflows then you will likely lose work at some point. At the start of any project it's recommended to pick a branching strategy and make sure your whole team understands it.

- `Forking it via the GitHub interface.`
- `git fork` [Correct answer]
- `git clone`

2. In Git, which error would you get if you try to push master-branch changes to a remote repository,
and someone else pushed changes to that same branch while you were making your changes?
- `Rejected` [Correct answer]
- `404`
- `500`
